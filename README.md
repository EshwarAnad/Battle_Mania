# ProGrad Junior Battle Mania ⚔️

Phineas and Ferb are twin-brothers living in the city of Danville. They spend most of their weekends building exciting projects using HTML, CSS and JavaScript (when they are not playing with their pet  Perry ...the platypus). One fine day, while watching their favourite superhero series, Phineas exclaimed "Hey, Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!". They started listing down names of their favorite superheroes. Meanwhile their common friend Isabel arrives in a singing tone asking  “Whatcha Doin”( What are you doing ?). Phineas replies “We are building a new game…… Battle Mania”.

Battle Mania has two sets of superheroes who are trying to win a battle. Each time a superhero is selected from a team, the battle begins. The one with greater strength among the two gets declared as the winner and the respective team scores a point. This battle between superheroes continues until the last superhero is left with strength.
